 Linking PHYML statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on PHYML.
 Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
 .
 In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of PHYML give you permission to combine
 PHYML with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code
 included in the standard release of PHYLIP under the University of Washington license (or modified
 versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following
 the terms of the GNU GPL for PHYML and the licenses of the other code concerned.
 .
 Note that people who make modified versions of PHYML are not obligated to grant this special exception
 for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
 permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible
 to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.

 The contributions of all involved persons is small enough to be put in
 public domain.  The former "unknown" is not accepted by lintian any more
 and would lead to an auto-rejection otherwise.
